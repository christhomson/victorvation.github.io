          <section class="content"><p>Welcome to 1A <span class="caps">ECE</span>. It’s the largest engineering program by population at UWaterloo, with three sections of classes spread over two streams. The <span class="caps">ECE</span> buildings are E2, the upper floors of <span class="caps">EIT</span>, and the 5<span class="ord">th</span> floor of E5. Not that you’ll have classes in those buildings until second year - first year engineering classes are scheduled by the First Year Engineering office, so you’ll probably be in <span class="caps">MC</span> and <span class="caps">RCH</span>. And B2 for some&nbsp;reason.</p>
<h2 id="frosh-week">Frosh Week</h2>
<p>UWaterloo is one of the few universities that have a frosh week that lasts the entire week. This means you’ll probably be bored of it by the end of the week. Resist the temptation to skip events if you’re just going to be sitting around playing LoL - definitely go to meet new people and try to enjoy it. It’s much more fun than what you’ll be doing for the 16 weeks that&nbsp;follow.</p>
<h2 id="term-progression">Term Progression</h2>
<p>The first half of the term will be mostly spend adjusting to university life and telling hundreds of people your hometown, your program, and your residence. One piece of advice I would give is to meet and be friendly with as many people in your program as possible. You’re going to be spending more than 30-40 hours per day, five days a week, for the next five years of your life with these people - wouldn’t you prefer it to be a group of people that you like and who like you, rather than who you don’t like and who don’t like&nbsp;you?</p>
<p>One day, one of your instructors will mention something about midterms. Suddenly, your classmates become instant experts on how midterms are run, what things to study, what to do to prepare. It seems like everyone will be freaking out and losing their minds, even the TAs and&nbsp;professors.</p>
<p>This is mostly to scare you into studying. The biggest thing I can stress is to not stress out about it. Midterms are really not weighted that much, and although failing a midterm can be a shock to people who’ve pulled easy 90s throughout highschool. Obviously this isn’t an excuse to have a flippant attitude about midterms - you should still study your hardest, but just know if you do fail a midterm, it isn’t completely the end of the world - there are some options you can take like reduced course load - although this is clearly non-ideal, but it’s there if you need it. In the end, though, remember that this is only 20-30% of your mark. Your final exam, which is 40-60%, is what you should <em>really</em> freak out&nbsp;about.</p>
<h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>
<p>A lot of people ask about how hard <span class="caps">ECE</span> is. For context, I went to an incredibly small high school in a relatively small town, won the Governer General’s Bronze Medal without doing much actual studying, and I found the first term fairly difficult. How hard you find 1A pretty much depends on the quality of education you recieved in high school. However, if you did breeze through high school, you will eventually need to learn to properly study in order to&nbsp;succeed.</p>
<h2 id="courses">Courses</h2>
<p>Here are my summaries of the courses in 1A, with my instructor’s names. They significantly changed the structure of the <span class="caps">ECE</span> program in 2010(?), so this was the third year of the new <span class="caps">ECE</span>&nbsp;curriculum.</p>
<h3 id="ece-105-firas-mansour-"><span class="caps">ECE</span> 105 (Firas&nbsp;Mansour)</h3>
<p>It’s your worst nightmare. It’s what your frosh leaders have been telling you horror stories about all week. It’s probably going to be your lowest mark. It’s the first year engineering “hell” course, <span class="caps">PHYS</span> 115, with additional chapters on simple harmonic motion, and travelling/standing waves thrown in because this is <em>Electrical</em> and Computer Engineering, and then also some thermophysics because why not? You’ll probably do poorly on the midterm, but you’ll do better on the final. The mark will probably be adjusted, but don’t count on it to pass. Do your assignments and quizzes, go to the help sessions (if you have Mansour) and most importantly, don’t fall behind. The material moves at a breakneck speed, and if you falter, you’ll find it difficult to catch&nbsp;up.</p>
<h4 id="good-parts">Good Parts</h4>
<p>You learn to calculate how to throw something so it will hit another thrown object in mid air! Also, it’s interesting to see the derivation/connection to calculus of the equations you’ve been using since grade 11. At the very least, you’ll come out with war stories that you can scare frosh&nbsp;with.</p>
<h3 id="ece-150-george-freeman-"><span class="caps">ECE</span> 150 (George&nbsp;Freeman)</h3>
<p>The Fundamentals of Programming. It’s taught in C# with an extremely heavy emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming from day one. It covers grade 11-12 Computer Science in about a month, and then goes on to cover linked lists, sorting algorithims, and touches on some higher order functions/functional stuff. Pretty much a snoozefest if you’ve taken high school programming. If you’re new to programming, make sure you fully understand what you’re doing in the programming assignments - the final is often underestimated, to poor&nbsp;results. </p>
<h4 id="good-parts">Good Parts</h4>
<p>If you took high school programming with Java/C#/C++ and found it easy, I have good news for you: you probably won’t have to go to many classes/lectures/tutorials for this course. If not, labs and tutorials are not that bad, as they’re run by <span class="caps">WEEF</span> TAs - TAs who are upper year students on co-op - and generally pretty interactive and&nbsp;entertaining.</p>
<h3 id="ece-140-andrew-kennings-"><span class="caps">ECE</span> 140 (Andrew&nbsp;Kennings)</h3>
<p>Circuits! Covers <span class="caps">KVL</span>/<span class="caps">KCL</span>, Norton/Thevenin, Node/Mesh analysis, op-amp circuits, and <span class="caps">AC</span> circuits/<span class="caps">AC</span> power. Similarily to other 1A courses, if you took Computer Engineering in high school, this will be a (relative) cakewalk. If not, then it might not be so much. You’ll find that the last few chapters of the course - starting from <span class="caps">AC</span> circuits to complex power - gets rushed and compressed to only a few weeks, yet it represents probably half of the final. Make sure you know it well. If you’re the kind who finds circuit analysis difficult, like myself, there’s no other way to learn how to do it except to just take a full day or two and grind out problem after problem until you really, really, <em>really</em> know how to do&nbsp;it. </p>
<h4 id="good-parts">Good Parts</h4>
<p>Your first experience with <span class="caps">ECE</span> labs. Playing with breadboards is super fun. Also, because of a strangely-/poorly-timed curriculum, you’ll probably encounter imaginary numbers and the imaginary plane for the first time in this&nbsp;course. </p>
<h3 id="math-117-reza-seyyedali-"><span class="caps">MATH</span> 117 (Reza&nbsp;Seyyedali)</h3>
<p>Calculus. The first half is review of grade 11 up to derivatives, with some mathematical definitions to make it feel more university-like: *<span class="caps">VT</span> (<span class="caps">IVT</span>, <span class="caps">MVT</span>, <span class="caps">EVT</span>), continuous functions, inverse functions. Also, Epsilon-Delta proof of the limit, which are the bane of many a first-year engineer. The second half goes into derivatives and optimization problems, and then Riemann sums and <span class="caps">FTC</span>, then methods of integration (u-sub, trig-sub, fraction decomposition, by parts). I found this course pretty fair, and the concepts are incredibly important and used throughout the rest of the&nbsp;program.</p>
<h4 id="good-parts">Good Parts</h4>
<p>Calculus. I mean really, most people come into <span class="caps">ECE</span> enjoying calculus anyway, but this course pretty much gives the fundamentals for most <span class="caps">EE</span> concepts, so yeah that’s pretty cool, what program is this again? Also, it’s the “harder” engineering calculus course (some other programs take 116, which is the same but without the more advanced integration&nbsp;methods).</p>
<h3 id="che-102-leonardo-simon-">ChE 102 (Leonardo&nbsp;Simon)</h3>
<p>Chemistry. Pretty much a review of grade 12, with some more in-depth things thrown in. There’s a heavy emphasis on methods of problem solving - knowing what operations to do and what order to do them in for a given question. Also, conversion questions - oh god the conversion questions. Ultimately it’s a pretty boring class, but it’s supposed to teach you critical thinking skills and it’s a requirement for the program’s accreditation. So there’s&nbsp;that.</p>
<h4 id="good-parts">Good Parts</h4>
<p>The final and midterm are multiple choice. Tutorials have “assignments”, which you can work on in groups. Assignment solutions are in the solution manual for the textbook. Which pretty much makes this a blow-off course. Also, the final has the exact same question “archetypes” each year, so make sure you know how to do those <em>types</em> of questions and you’ll find it difficult to get less than a 10-12/15. Also, you get a crib sheet for the final and&nbsp;midterm.</p>
